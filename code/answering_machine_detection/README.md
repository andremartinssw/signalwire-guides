# Answering Machine Detection (for guide but most importantly for Plappert case 00016066)

This is the code that I've gotten so far, and it works but not 100% correctly. The <Say> starts before the voicemail beep plays, so the recording is a few sentences too late. I don't want to share with Plappert until we can make sure that the full message plays for him, and same for creating the guide of course. Hoping that you are able to figure it out and thanks for your help!
