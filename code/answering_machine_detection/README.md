# Answering Machine Detection
This guide utilizes Answering Machine Detection to determine whether a human or voicemail machine has picked up the phone so that it can either dial a number to connect someone to the human or leave a message for the voicemail box. 

When a call is initiated with `machine_detection` set to `DetectMessageEnd`, there is a parameter posted to the webhook called AnsweredBy. The potential options here are `machine_end_other`, `machine_end_beep`, `machine_end_silence`, and `human`. If the parameter returned is anything other than human, this example will take a short pause to wait for the beep and then play a message for the intended recipient. If the parameter returned is human, it will dial a number to connect the human to another person.

We start with the necessary imports below and set the port to 8080. 

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'signalwire'

set :port, 8080
```

Here we create a route for Sinatra and initialize response as a VoiceResponse object so that we can use Say, Dial, Hangup, and Pause. 


```ruby
post '/start' do
  response = Signalwire::Sdk::VoiceResponse.new
```

Now we use a switch statement to designate that we will take different actions depending on the value of `[:AnsweredBy]`. You can see below that if anything other than human is returned, this code will output "It's a machine", take a brief pause to allow the voicemail system time to reach the recording beep, leave a voicemail for the intended recipient, and hang up. If the value returned is human, this code will output "We got ourselves a live human here!" and then dial the number of your agent (or the next part of your standard call flow). In the dial, you have the option to either hard code the number you would like to dial or use environment variables. 


```ruby
case params[:AnsweredBy]
  when 'machine_end_other', 'machine_end_silence', 'machine_end_beep'
    puts "It's a machine!"
    # put in a little pause to allow the recording to start on the other end
    response.pause(length: 1)
    # replace messsage with whatever voicemail you want to leave
    response.say(message: "Hello! This is the County Medical Center. We are calling you to confirm your doctor appointment. Please call us back as soon as possible.")
    response.hangup
  when 'human'
    puts "We got ourselves a live human here!"
    response.dial do |dial|
      # defaulting to calling a time voice announcement number as an example
      dial.number(ENV.fetch('AGENT_NUMBER', '+12027621401'))
    end
  end
```

Lastly, we need to put in code for the sake of debugging the LaML. LaML requires that proper XML is returned or it will not work correctly. 
```ruby
  puts response.to_s
  response.to_s
```

When `[:AnsweredBy]` returns any value other than human, the XML code is a simple `<Say>`.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
<Say>Hello! This is the County Medical Center. We are calling you to confirm your doctor appointment. Please call us back as soon as possible.</Say>
</Response>
```

When `[:AnsweredBy]` returns human, the XML code consists of a `<Dial>`. 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Dial>
    <Number>
      202-762-1401
    </Number>
  </Dial>
</Response>
 ```
  
## Triggering calls
There are a number of different ways that you could trigger your outbound call, but here are two examples using Ruby and cURL. The most important takeaway from these is that no matter how you initiate your call, you must have `machine_detection` set to `DetectMessageEnd`. There is another paramter option `enable`, but that will not work in the same way. The parameter `enable` would work if you wanted to do some action for a human and hang up if the answering party is a machine, however, it will not allow you to take specific actions in both scenarios. 

You will need your SignalWire Project ID, auth token, and space URL. You can easily find all three values in a copyable format in your SignalWire Dashboard by clicking the API tab on the lefthand sidebar. 

As the above code is written in Ruby, you can always stay consistent and iniate the call using the SignalWire Ruby SDK. You can either set environment variables on your computer, or you can replace the ENV variables with your Project ID, auth token, and space URL. 

```ruby
client = Signalwire::REST::Client.new ENV['SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_KEY'], ENV['SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN'], signalwire_space_url: ENV['SIGNALWIRE_SPACE']

  call = client.calls.create(
    url: ENV['APP_DOMAIN'] + '/start',
    to: params[:to],
    from: ENV['FROM_NUMBER'],
    machine_detection: "DetectMessageEnd"
  )
```

You can also use cURL on your commmand prompt or with a tool such as postman to send HTTP requests to create the call. You will need to replace the ProjectID and Space URL within the cURL URL, as well as the webhook pointing to this code, the To number, the From number, and the authentication at the bottom. 


```bash
curl https://YOURSPACE.signalwire.com/api/laml/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/Calls.json \
  -X POST \
  --data-urlencode "Url=YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL" \
  --data-urlencode "To=DESTINATION-NUMBER" \
  --data-urlencode "From=CALLER-ID-FROM-SIGNALWIRE-ACCOUNT" \
  --data-urlencode 'MachineDetection=DetectMessageEnd' \
  -u "YOUR-PROJECT-ID:YOUR-TOKEN"
```

## Docker instructions

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and edit.

Build with `docker build . -t rubyamd`

Run with `docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --name rubyamd --env-file .env rubyamd`


## Testing locally

You may need to use a SSH tunnel for testing this code â€“ we recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). After starting the tunnel, you can use the URL you receive from `ngrok` in your webhook configuration for your phone number.

## Sign Up Here
