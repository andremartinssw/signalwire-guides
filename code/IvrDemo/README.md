# Minimal Dotnet Core C# IVR example

This is a very simple example of how to gather input from a user and act accordingly.

It is based on the Dotnet Web API quickstart.

To run it, use `dotnet restore` followed by `dotnet run` and head to [http://localhost:3232/api/voice](http://localhost:3232/api/voice)

To test the application with SignalWire while running locally, I recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
