# SignalWire Trial Mode

Every SignalWire account, when it is first created, is in trial mode. That means there are some limitations, to protect our services from potential abuse, and our new users from causing extensive issues.

## What are the trial mode limitations?

There are a few classes of limitations we will list here for reference:

Activity limitations:
- You can only dial or receive calls from numbers you have verified
- You can only send messages or receive messages from numbers you have verified
- SIP endpoints can register but you can't place outbound calls or receive traffic on a Domain App

Resource count limitations:
- Maximum of 2 project
- Maximum of 2 DIDs per project
- Only 5 queued calls at a time
- Only 5 queued messages at a time
- You can only hold 5 verified caller IDs at a time
- Your top-up limit is $50

Other limitations:
- No international calling
- DIDs cannot be released for 30 days

## How do you exit trial mode?

It is very simple to exit trial mode.

All you need to do is add a major credit card to your account and **add at least 5$ of credit**.

Promotions and codes do not count towards the total.

### My credit card was declined

We accept all major credit and debit cards through our processor.
If your card is declined:

- Check with your issuer that your credit card is active and valid
- If you are in Canada or India, please submit a support ticket. We are currently handling customers from those specific countries through a separate process.
- If you are using a VPN or corporate firewall, try clearing your cache or connecting through a different network, then remove the card and add it again.
- Pre-paid or secured credit cards are currently not accepted.

## Setting up Auto Top Up

If you are planning on using your SignalWire account for production traffic, you should add an Auto Top Up method to ensure you do not run out of funds.

The very simple process is detailed in [this knowledge base article](https://signalwire.force.com/help/s/article/How-To-Set-Up-Auto-Top-Up).
